Asciiquarium screensaver for Windows

Created by Jean Sommer, contributions by Russell Goring

Kirk Baucom originally wrote the ASCIIQuarium animation in Perl. His website, and the original ASCIIQuarium,
with links to other ports can be found here: https://robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/. Thereâ€™s also a
freshmeat page for the Perl version of the program here: http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/asciiquarium

J. Sommer took this idea and created a Windows screensaver out of it. This is the source for the Windows version.
